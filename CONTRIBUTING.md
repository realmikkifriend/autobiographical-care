## How to Contribute

The source text for this Guide website is hosted in a Github repository. You can contribute by opening either issues or pull requests (PRs). Note that since maintainers are volunteers, there may unfortunately be a delay of days or even weeks before you receive a response.

### Opening an Issue

Use this option if you're unfamiliar with PRs, just want to make a minor suggestion, or want to start a discussion.

In the Github repo, visit the Issues tab, and click 'New issue'. Give your issue a descriptive title, and write out your suggestion or discussion topic. (Don't worry if you make a mistake, you can edit these later.) Once you open it, the repo administrator(s) will be notified.

### Opening a PR

Use this option when making major changes, such as rewording passages or adding new passages or pages.
