# Guide to Writing Autobiographical Case Reports _(autobiographical-care)_

An open-source guide to writing autobiographical case reports. For more, see the [Introduction](guide/introduction.md).

## Abstract

This guide explores considerations unique to the writing of autobiographical case reports, and emphasizes the importance of personal narratives in medical and academic literature. While the existing CARE (CAse REport) Guidelines provide a framework for traditional case reports, they do not explicitly address self-reported experiences. Autobiographical case reports enable individuals, including patients, caregivers, and professionals, to articulate their journeys through rare or atypical conditions, contributing valuable insights to clinical understanding and advocacy.

This guide serves to empower individuals from underrepresented populations to document their experiences, thereby enhancing self-advocacy and promoting awareness of complex health challenges. Key reasons for writing these reports include providing new information about uncommon conditions, reflecting on significant personal impacts, and addressing gaps in medical, scientific, literary, and academic knowledge. These self-reported narratives can inspire further research, inform treatment practices, and embolden those who share similar experiences.
