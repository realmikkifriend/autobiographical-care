# Guide to Writing Autobiographical Case Reports _(autobiographical-care)_

An open-source guide to writing autobiographical case reports. For more, see the [Introduction](guide/introduction.md).

## Abstract

A case report is a structured document that explores one or more interrelated conditions, experiences, treatments, outcomes, and so on. While considered low on the hierarchy of evidence, they offer valuable insights into otherwise poorly-understood phenomena, and are distributed throughout medical, scientific, literary, and academic disciplines. The CARE (CAse REport) Guidelines are widely considered the standard, but do not address somewhat unique situations in which one writes about one's own case.

Writing autobiographical case reports enables individuals, including patients, caregivers, and professionals, to articulate their journeys through rare or atypical conditions. Key reasons for writing these reports include providing new information about uncommon conditions, reflecting on significant personal impacts, and addressing gaps in published research. This guide especially seeks to empower individuals from underrepresented populations to document their experiences, enhancing self-advocacy and promoting awareness of complex health challenges. These self-reported narratives can inspire further research, inform treatment practices, and embolden those who share similar experiences. This guide explores considerations unique to the writing of autobiographical case reports, including ethics, voice, and modifications to the recommended structure.
